# Credit_card_Fraud_Detection
Credit card fraud detection is a crucial task in financial security, helping banks and payment systems identify fraudulent transactions before they cause financial loss. This project applies Machine Learning techniques to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised and unsupervised learning approaches.
The two key techniques used:
- Supervised Learning: Logistic Regression is applied to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine based on historical labeled data.
- Unsupervised Learning: Isolation Forest is used for anomaly detection, recognizing outliers in transaction patterns that might be fraudulent.
Project Motivation
Financial fraud is increasing rapidly, and traditional methods like rule-based detection often fail to detect new and sophisticated fraud patterns. This project aims to:
- Develop an effective machine learning model for fraud detection.
- Compare different approaches to identify the best performing method.
- Provide visualizations to understand fraudulent transaction patterns.
- Make it easy for financial institutions to integrate fraud detection models.

Project Workflow
This project follows a structured machine learning workflow:
Step 1: Data Preprocessing
- Load and clean dataset.
- Handle missing values.
- Normalize transaction amounts.
Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize fraud vs. non-fraud transaction amounts.
- Identify patterns in fraudulent transactions.
Step 3: Model Training
Supervised Approach
- Train Logistic Regression model on labeled fraud data.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall.
Unsupervised Approach
- Apply Isolation Forest for fraud detection using anomaly detection.
- Optimize contamination level to improve results.
Step 4: Fraud Detection & Prediction
- Use trained models to detect fraudulent transactions in new data.
- Compare performance of supervised vs unsupervised methods.
Step 5: Visualization
- Scatter plot to show fraudulent transactions.
- Histogram for transaction amount distributions.
- Confusion matrix for model performance analysis.

Results
Supervised Learning (Logistic Regression)
- Model Accuracy: XX%
- Precision & Recall: XX%
- Fraud correctly classified: XX Transactions
- Pros: Works well with labeled data.
